   Changes made to gitgraph.js:

- Message colour in "BlackArrow" template changed from "black" to "#000000" (for consistency)

- Tidied svg path in function "createTag" (adding brackets, changing end-point of returning horizontal line, removing unnecessary bits)

- Made branch label border thickness customisable ("branch.label.strokeWidth")

- Made arrowhead angle customisable ("arrow.angle") to make arrowhead wider/narrower (as opposed to "arrow.size" attribute which changes arrowhead length)

- Added arrow centering option ("arrow.centered", defaults to "false"); intended for use with "bezier" mergestyle, as with it the path and arrows don't align

- Modified function "arrowSvgPath" (and Template class) for option to position arrow in centre between relevant commits

- Modified function "arrowSvgPath" to fix arrow position for centered merge/diverge commits with longer spacing

- Added adaptive brightness function to return appropriate shade of grey
   (light if argument colour is dark, dark if argument colour is light;
    4 shades of grey for four quarters of brightness range)
   (see "greyscale.py" - greys chosen largely aesthetically)

- In function "createBranchLabel", changed "fill: branch.style.label.bgColor" to use new adaptive brightness function (above)

- In function "createTag", changed "fill: tag.style.color" to use new adaptive brightness function (above)

- Changed commit dotText colour using adaptive brightness function (above)

- In function "renderArrows", changed default colour to use new adaptive brightness function (above)

- Adjusted positioning of branch labels (in functions "positionCommitsElements" and "moveElement") to better align with other features

- Added "startingPoint" property to Branch class (and modified function "renderBranchLabels") to display a branch label at the commit it started from if there are no other commits on that branch

- Modified functions "initCommitElements" and "positionCommitsElements" to allow for display of multiple branch labels

- Added "unreachable" property to commits (defaults to "no", could also be "yes" or "detached HEAD"): prevents branch labels being shown (if "yes"); and changes colours for label (if "detached HEAD" - functions "createBranchLabel" and "renderBranchLabels"), dot (function "renderDot"), arrow (function "renderArrows"), and path (function "computeBranchesColor")

- Added "unreachableColours" property (array of length 3 - intended as light, dark, and warning colour) to templates, to allow customisation (adapted functions "createBranchLabel", "renderBranchLabels", "renderDot", "renderArrows", and "computeBranchesColor" accordingly)
