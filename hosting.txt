   https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitHosting

Lists (explicitly git) hosting services. The following provide open-source/private repos for free, with unlimited space (others restrict it to 1GB or less), listed in order of "popularity" (see below):

- GitHub (3 collaborators for free private repos)
- SourceForge (doesn't provide free private repos)
- BitBucket (5 collaborators for free private repos)
- GitLab (framework is open-source)
- RocketGit
- Visual Studio Team Services (doesn't provide free open-source repos, 5 users for free private repos), probably irrelevant as Microsoft bought GitHub
